# Fuck-Nestle

Nestle is a pretty hate-able company for a number of reasons. Enough that it warrents an entire subreddit based on a mutual hate of this large corporation. I will link to a couple of articles of what makes this company so bad. 

Unfortunately, being the behemoth that it is (and with a 30% stake in L'Oréal), it is difficult to escape. So this app will seek out to allow it to be easier to avoid Nestle and spend your money elsewhere. 

### How to use:
This app will use a barcode numerical entry that will use webscraping techniques to search for the company that produces the product. 
I have compiled a list of subsidiaries that are under the parent company of nestle [Source.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestl%C3%A9_brands). This app will take the result and compare with the list. Essentially making it the hot dog not hot dog of evil corporations. 

This app currently uses a numerical entry and web scraping to get the job done but it would be cool to have an image processing aspect and to deploy into an app or maybe even a twitter bot. Also need to add in L'Oréal and it's subsidiaries as well..
